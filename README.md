# Dinner Planner

## Getting started

1. Check that you have `npm` installed on your system (you can follow the instructions
   from [Installing Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

2. Run `npm install` through the terminal in the root directory of the repository. Let it
   install all of the dependencies.

3. Run `npm run start` through the terminal. This will start the webserver and the application should pop up in your
   browser ready for use. Alternatively, you can open in through [http://localhost:3000].
   
Please **note** that you may need your own Spoonacular API key to load data in the application.
